## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- `uv` (or `pip` for package management)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danishhshahid/Game-Master-AI-Agent.git
    cd Game-Master-Agent
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using `uv`:**

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    *Alternatively, using `pip` (if `uv` is not installed):*

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your Google API Key:**

    The game uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model. You need to obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.

    Set your API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
    # For Windows (Command Prompt):
    # set GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    # For Windows (PowerShell):
    # $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Google API Key.

### Running the Game

To start the game, run the `app.py` file using Chainlit:

```bash
chainlit run app.py -w
```

This will open the Chainlit web interface in your browser, where you can start playing.

## üéÆ How to Play

Once the Chainlit interface is open:

-   Type your actions naturally (e.g., "I explore the forest", "I attack the goblin").
-   The AI will respond, guiding you through the story.

### Special Commands

-   **`status`**: Show your current health and inventory.
-   **`history`**: See recent conversation history.
-   **`restart`**: Start a new game.
-   **`prompt: your message`**: Send a custom prompt directly to the AI to influence its response.
